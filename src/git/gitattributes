# Automatically normalize line endings for all text-based files.
# Due to differences between Windows and Mac/Linux systems on
# how they treat line endings (i.e. \r\n versus \n)
#   https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_end_of_line_conversion
#     Set to string value "auto"
#       When text is set to "auto", the path is marked for automatic end-of-line
#       normalization. If Git decides that the content is text, its line endings
#       are normalized to LF on checkin.
#     Unspecified
#       If the text attribute is unspecified, Git uses the core.autocrlf
#       configuration variable to determine if the file should be converted.

# * text=auto
